# GameChip
Inspired by the Classic GameBoy, this App allows the User to Select from a List of Games, including:
 - Knight's Travails
 - Tic-Tac-Toe
 - Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Knight's Travails
Classically, the Chessboard is a battleground whereby two armies take on each other, with a number of tactics they may be able to employ. One such tactic is the use of the Knight, which arguably, has the most unusual traversal around the Chessboard, an L-shape. It is this unusual traversal that has spawned may puzzles associated with the Knight, and two such puzzles are available for the User to attempt.

### Shortest Path Puzzle
Given a random Goal tile, and a selected Start tile, can you find the shortest path to that tile? Can you beat the AI at finding the shortest path? The AI in question uses the famous Breadth-First Search Algorithm, adapted for the Knight's unique traversal, to find that path.

### Knight's Tour Puzzle
The Knight's Tour is a famous puzzle associated with the Knight, whereby the goal is to traverse all the tiles on the Chessboard, but each tile can only be traversed once! Can you find a Tour for any given starting tile? The AI certainly can. This algorithm uses Warnsdorff's rule, which always chooses it's next tile based on it's least number of available next moves.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
All school children know this puzzle, when they are bored in class and draw a grid and challenge their neighbour. Now, you have an opportunity to play against an AI.

### Easy Level
Anyone can beat the Easy level, it just randomly selects any cell that hasn't been marked!

### Hard Level
Using the Minimax Algorithm, this AI always chooses it's next move such that it minimises any losses. Can you beat it? Drawing is not winning.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
Ever wanted to play this game without moving your hands? Ever wanted to play against a computer? Well here's your chance! With 3 levels of difficulty to choose from, this rendition of the ever-enduring game will have you hooked for hours trying to beat the AI.

### Easy Level
Piece of cake, this level will "rock" your world.

### Medium Level
Can random choices really be called "intelligent"?

### Hard Level
Markov Chains are used across many fields to help predict outcomes of events, and perhaps you're just predictable enough that the AI will be able to beat you more often that you could beat it. Only one way to find out.
